digit buttons:
  1: display is blank and digit is 0: REJECTED
  2: display is blank and digit is not 0: set num1
  3: display is not blank: concat onto num1

  4 - 6: same as above except num1 and operator are already set; in this case the same things happen but to num2 instead of num1

operator buttons:
  1: no num1: REJECTED
  2: there is a num1 but no num2: set operator
  3: num1 && num2: REJECTED
